This component is now just a skeleton.  Im now in the process of
integrating it into Nautilus in a sane way.  There will be lots of
changes happening here soon.  

There will also be many changes needed to the embedding widget - on
the mozilla side of things.

If you have questions, comments or would like to help make this a
robust and politically correct way to do the http thing in GNOME, send
