For eazel-helper to work, it must be installed in a well-known
location, and it needs two config files to be placed in the PAM setup
directories.  Here are the files I use:

###  /etc/pam.d/eazel-helper  ###
#%PAM-1.0
auth       sufficient   /lib/security/pam_rootok.so
auth       required     /lib/security/pam_pwdb.so
session    optional     /lib/security/pam_xauth.so
account    required     /lib/security/pam_permit.so

###  /etc/security/console.apps/eazel-helper ###
USER=root
PROGRAM=/root/eazel-helper
SESSION=true
FALLBACK=true



Obviously, PROGRAM in the latter file is where to find the actual
binary for eazel-helper.  I'm not sure what SESSION and FALLBACK do; I
just copied them from helix-update.  Likewise the whole pam.d file is
just a copy from helix-update.  There may be better contents for these
files than my ham-handed bumbling.

The whole setup requires "userhelper" to be installed in /usr/sbin.
On Redhat, this is package "usermode-1.20-1".


Weirdly, "userhelper" doesn't seem to work remotely.  Not sure what
the deal is.
