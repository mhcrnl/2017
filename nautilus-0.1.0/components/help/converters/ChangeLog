	* gnome-info2html2/main.c (main): Use g_free on the node as it
	  has been allocated with g_malloc

	* gnome-man2html2/gnome-man2html.c (scan_format):  Patch from gnome
	  bug number 3925.  From the description: Briefly, gnome-man2html

	  the last thing in the format specification is a font command.

	with a rough cut.

	* gnome-man2html2/gnome-man2html.c, gnome-man2html2/Makefile.am:
	Make it look up a file location and use it, if just passed
	something like 'ls.1' on the cmdline. Also use zlib to handle
	compressed manpages.

	* gnome-db2html2/Makefile.am: Added new converter to list.  Does
	rough on-the-fly docbook to html conversion.  Not perfect yet
	(never will be) but good enough (tm) until we can get a better
	solution for jade.
