This directory contains a beta version of freetype2, bludgeoned into
building with autoconf and libtool in such a way that the resulting
library can be reasonably linked from librsvg.

The files were adapted from the following freetype2 beta release:

675570 Jul 17 23:42 freetype2-current.tar.gz
2070c12bfe81f66271a0f053123bb6f8  freetype2-current.tar.gz

Because automake has a very difficult time dealing with source files
in more than one directory, I decided to flatten everything. Thus,
FT_FLAT_COMPILE is turned on. In most cases, use of this is #ifdef'd,
so that files can go back into the main freetype2 build tree without
breaking that.

The plan, at least as far as I understand it, is to move to an RPM'ed
version of this library as soon as it goes into full release. In the
meantime, this version should suffice, more or less unmodified.

Please see http://www.freetype.org/ for definitive releases and
information about freetype.
